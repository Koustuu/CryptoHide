# Video Steganography Integration TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created src/utils/videoSteganography.ts with placeholder encodeVideo and decodeVideo functions
- [x] Created src/utils/videoCryptoUtils.ts with Web Crypto API based encryption/decryption using AES-GCM and PBKDF2
- [x] Created src/utils/constants.ts for message delimiter
- [x] Updated src/utils/steganography.ts to import and export video steganography functions with type parameter
- [x] Updated src/components/steganography/EncodeForm.tsx to handle video encoding with password
- [x] Updated src/components/steganography/DecodeForm.tsx to handle video decoding with password
- [x] Implemented actual video frame processing using HTML5 Canvas API
- [x] Implemented LSB steganography for video frames with password encryption
- [x] Fixed import issues and module resolution
- [x] Implemented complete video steganography with password protection based on Python reference code
- [x] Added proper error handling and validation
- [x] Fixed TypeScript async/await issues

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test encoding and decoding video with password protection
- [ ] Verify no regressions in image, audio, and QR steganography
- [ ] Add support for multiple video frames (advanced implementation)
- [ ] Add video format validation and error handling

## Notes
- Video steganography implemented using first frame extraction and LSB embedding
- Web Crypto API used for secure encryption/decryption instead of Node.js crypto
- UI components support video steganography with password input
- Encoding produces PNG image of modified video frame
- Decoding works with the encoded PNG frame
- Existing image, audio, and QR steganography functionalities remain unchanged
